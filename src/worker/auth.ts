// socket: IPv4 `127.0.0.0/8`, IPv6 `::1`, and IPv4-mapped-IPv6 `::ffff:127.x`. An unknown/empty address

// arriving over loopback are ALWAYS served unauthenticated: in LAN mode the local client (the user's own
// Claude/Codex on this machine) keeps working with no key, exactly as in localhost mode; only genuinely
// remote callers must present the key. The loopback check is purely TCP-layer (see isLoopbackAddr) so it
// can't be spoofed by a header. The `exposed` term still covers the lan→localhost transition: the mode
// file flips immediately but this socket stays on 0.0.0.0 until the supervisor restarts it, so a REMOTE
// caller keeps being gated until a fresh loopback-bound worker takes over.
//   when a remote request needs a key:
//     • no key configured  → 503, fail closed (must never be an open proxy; defense-in-depth backstop —
//                            the UI/store already refuse to enter LAN keyless, so this only fires on a
//                            hand-edited file or ACCESS_MODE=lan env with no ACCESS_KEY).
//     • missing/invalid key → 401, rejected BEFORE any upstream call.
// Mount AFTER /healthz (the supervisor's readiness probe must stay open) and BEFORE the proxy routes.
// `isLocal` is injectable so tests (which drive over loopback) can simulate a remote peer.
