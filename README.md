## 60-second start

```bash
npx copilot-reverse
```

1. It asks you to log in to GitHub (device code — paste a code in your browser). One time only.
2. The terminal app launches. You'll see a prompt and a status bar.
3. In the app, type:
   ```
   /setup-claude
   ```
   Pick a model (e.g. **claude-opus-4.8 (1M)**), choose **global**, done.
4. Open a **new** terminal and run `claude`. It's now talking to Copilot through copilot-reverse. 🎉

That's it. Codex users: run `/setup-codex` instead.

Here's the app itself — a prompt, a live status bar, and slash-command autocomplete:

```text
 ✳ copilot-reverse                                                       worker: ready

 Type a message to chat with the assistant, or /help for commands.
╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ › /setup                                                                              │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
  ❯ /setup-claude   print Claude Code config
    /setup-codex    print Codex/OpenAI config
    /setup-status   show configured endpoints
    ↑↓ navigate · tab complete · enter run
 model claude-opus-4.8  ·  daemon ready  ·  claude u:✓ p:○  codex u:✓ p:○  ·  /help
```

---

## What can I do in the app?

Just **talk to it** — it understands plain English and will do the work for you:

> *"list models"* → shows every model + its context window
> *"set up claude"* → asks scope (global/project) + model, then configures Claude Code
> *"is the worker healthy?"* → runs a health check
> *"why did my last request fail?"* → shows the error (incl. cut-short stream runaways)

Prefer commands? Type `/` to see them all. The essentials:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/setup-claude` · `/setup-codex` | Point Claude Code / Codex at copilot-reverse |
| `/model` | Switch the chat model (1M-context models marked) |
| `/network` | Choose access mode: localhost (private) or LAN (shared, key required) |
| `/status` · `/doctor` | Is everything healthy? (`/status` shows each client's scope + model) |
| `/logs` · `/metrics` | What ran, what failed, and why |
| `/dashboard` | Open a live web dashboard in your browser |
| `/report` | File a pre-filled bug report (diagnostics only — no prompts) |
| `/reset-claude` · `/reset-codex` | Undo setup, restore original config |
| `/login` · `/logout` | Sign in to GitHub (device-code) · sign out (remove token) |
| `/help` · `/quit` | List commands · exit |

### The live dashboard

`/dashboard` opens a self-refreshing web view of everything happening through the proxy — worker
health, request volume, and (most useful) recent **errors with their real messages**:

## Native experience — it really *is* Claude Code

The whole point: through copilot-reverse, Claude Code (and Codex) behave like a direct connection to
the real thing. We translate the full protocol both ways and pass through the features that matter — so
you don't trade fidelity for a free backend.

- **🧠 Extended thinking, rendered natively.** Ask a hard question and Claude's reasoning streams into
  the same collapsible thinking panel you'd see on a direct API connection — a real
  `thinking` block (with its signed continuation token) ahead of the answer, frame-for-frame the
  Anthropic wire shape. The reasoning context is preserved across tool calls, just like native.
- **🎚 Reasoning effort that actually works.** `/effort low|medium|high|xhigh|max`, the
  `think` / `think harder` / `ultrathink` keywords, `CLAUDE_EFFORT` — the effort you pick is read from
  the real `output_config.effort` wire and forwarded upstream, so dialing reasoning up or down genuinely
  changes how hard the model thinks. (`curl -i` and you'll see the applied effort echoed back in an
  `x-copilot-reverse-effort` header.)
- **🪟 True 1M-context models.** 1M-window models show up in Claude Code's native picker with the right
  badge, and copilot-reverse writes the correct context-window hint so the client sizes its context bar
  and auto-compaction to the *real* window — no more "context 100%" at 15%.
- **🛠 Tool use, vision, web search — both directions.** Function/tool calls translate faithfully each
  way (even models that emit tool calls as inline XML are recovered), images round-trip, and
  `web_search` runs server-side through the gateway and comes back as a grounded answer — no tool leaks
  to the client.
- **📊 Accurate usage.** Real prompt/completion token counts, with cached tokens split out, so Claude
  Code's context bar and cost reflect what actually happened.
- **🛡 It never freezes.** If a model degenerates (loops on one token, never stops), the proxy cuts the
  stream cleanly as `max_tokens` instead of hanging your session — native Claude self-stops, and so does
  this.

> Stability and accuracy are the north star: using Claude through the proxy must feel **exactly** like
> native Claude. Every feature above is covered by a live, real-Copilot end-to-end test.

## Connect your own tools

Already have something that speaks OpenAI or Anthropic? Point it here:

- **OpenAI-compatible:** `http://127.0.0.1:7891/openai`
- **Anthropic-compatible:** `http://127.0.0.1:7891/anthropic`

Any API key value works locally (it's your machine). Example:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7891/anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=local
claude
```

### Share it on your network (LAN mode)

By default the proxy is **localhost** — bound to `127.0.0.1`, reachable only from this machine. To let
another device (a second laptop, a phone, a teammate) use it, run `/network` and switch to **LAN**:

- The worker rebinds to all interfaces and the panel shows your **LAN URL** (e.g. `http://192.168.1.5:7891`) and a generated **access key**.
- **Your own machine keeps working with no key.** The key is required only for requests coming from *other* machines — anything from this host over `127.0.0.1` is served as before. So your local Claude Code / Codex need no change when you flip to LAN.
- On the other machine, point your tool at that URL **plus the protocol path** — `…:7891/anthropic` for Claude Code, `…:7891/openai` for Codex/OpenAI — and send the key: `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (OpenAI/Codex) or `x-api-key: <key>` (Anthropic/Claude Code). A remote request **without a valid key is rejected (401)**.

```bash
# On the remote machine — Claude Code against the shared proxy:
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.5:7891/anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<the key from /network>
claude
```

For **Codex** on the remote machine, set the base URL (with the `/openai` path) and the key in
`~/.codex/config.toml` — the key goes in the `experimental_bearer_token` field:

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml on the remote machine
[model_providers.copilot-reverse]
base_url = "http://192.168.1.5:7891/openai"
experimental_bearer_token = "<the key from /network>"
```

- LAN is **fail-closed**: you can't enable it without a key, and the proxy refuses to serve if a key ever goes missing — it's never an open relay. Rotate the key anytime from the same panel (remote clients then re-paste the new key). Switch back to localhost to make it private again.
- **Firewall:** on Windows/macOS, the first time the worker binds all interfaces your OS may prompt to allow it — or you may need to add an inbound allow for port `7891`. If a second machine can't connect while the panel shows `⚠ LAN`, the host firewall is the usual cause.

> The supervisor/control plane (dashboard, restart) always stays on localhost — only the model proxy is ever exposed, and only behind the key.

## The status bar, decoded

The bottom line of the app tells you everything at a glance:

```text
model claude-opus-4.8  ·  daemon ready  ·  claude u:✓ p:○  codex u:○ p:○  ·  /help
```

- **worker / daemon** — green `ready` means the proxy is up and self-healing.
- **claude u:✓ p:○** — Claude Code is configured at the **u**ser (global) level, not in this **p**roject. Read live from your real config files.
- **net** — your access mode: `localhost` (private) or a highlighted `⚠ LAN` when the proxy is shared on the network (run `/network` to change).

---

## Troubleshooting

**"context 100%" or `/compact` fails in Claude Code**
Re-run `/setup-claude` and pick a **1M** model (e.g. `claude-opus-4.8 (1M)`). copilot-reverse writes
the right context-window hint so the client stops assuming a small window. Then restart Claude Code.

**"GitHub login expired"**
Your Copilot session lapsed. You don't need to restart anything — when a chat fails, copilot-reverse
detects it and tells you right there:

```text
assistant error: 401 authentication_error: GitHub login expired
  ↳ your GitHub login looks expired — run /login to sign in again
```

Just type **`/login`**, complete the device-code prompt, and you're back — the worker reloads the new
token automatically. (Switching accounts? `/logout` first, then `/login`.)

**A request failed and I don't know why**
Type `/logs` (or ask *"why did that fail?"*). Every failure is captured with its real upstream
message. Still stuck? `/report` opens a pre-filled GitHub issue with diagnostics — **never** your
prompt content.

**Want to undo everything**
`/reset-claude` and `/reset-codex` remove exactly the keys copilot-reverse added and leave the rest
of your config untouched.

---

## Good to know

- **Your data stays local.** The app proxies between your editor and Copilot on `127.0.0.1`. Your
  GitHub token lives only in `~/.copilot-reverse/creds.json` on your own disk.
- **It heals itself.** If the proxy crashes, the supervisor restarts it with backoff and records why.
- **A cut-short stream is flagged, not hidden.** When the runaway guard ends a degenerate stream early,
  it's tagged in `/logs` and `/report` files a prefilled issue — so the rare bad turn is easy to surface.
- **Tunable.** `~/.copilot-reverse` config covers ports, restart backoff, and the GitHub-token
  heartbeat interval; defaults are sensible, override only if needed.
- **Unofficial endpoints.** This uses community-documented Copilot endpoints with *your own*
  subscription. It may break if GitHub changes them — that's the trade-off for not needing extra keys.

---

## Architecture

Three processes, one terminal app:

- **TUI** (Ink) — the `copilot-reverse` process: REPL + slash commands + a claude-agent-sdk
  assistant (which dogfoods copilot-reverse's own Anthropic endpoint).
- **Supervisor** (:7890) — control API + SQLite + self-healing worker supervision.
- **Worker** (:7891) — OpenAI `/openai/chat/completions` + Anthropic `/anthropic/v1/messages` → Copilot,
  with tool-use translation both ways. Each protocol also serves a `…/models` discovery endpoint.

## Development

Requires Node >=20.

```bash
npm install && npm test && npm run build
```

### End-to-end tests

The [`e2e/`](e2e/) folder holds cross-module end-to-end scenarios (real worker + supervisor +
TUI wiring, fake Copilot provider). The case catalog is [`e2e/cases.md`](e2e/cases.md) and the
latest run is [`e2e/RESULTS.md`](e2e/RESULTS.md).

**Every code change must keep the full e2e suite green.** `npm test` runs it (the suite is
included in the default vitest run); `npm run test:e2e` runs only the e2e cases. After a change,
re-run and update `e2e/RESULTS.md`.

### Test notes

- **TUI input tests** (`tests/tui/app.test.tsx`): the test waits ~30 ms after
  `render()` before writing to `stdin`. This is not flakiness padding — Ink's
  `useInput` subscribes to stdin asynchronously after mount, so writes issued in
  the same tick as `render()` are dropped. The delay lets the subscription
  attach; assertions are otherwise unchanged.
